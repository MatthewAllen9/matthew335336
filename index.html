  <p>Spotify is an accessible and easy to use software that allows the user to play and download music and podcasts. The application is available on both mobile and computer devices. The home page displays all saved music and playlists, recommended songs and albums, and the current song that is playing at all times. Additionally, the search feature has numerous sub genres and provides suggestions based off of the current search and the users unique music taste. Users are also provided the ability to create accounts and connect to others to save their music and podcasts as well. While playing music, the listener can skip the song, pause, rewind, connect to audio output hardware and read the lyrics. The simplicity and use of black and green helps the software remain recognizable. The limited and large button icons help the software feel user friendly and easy to use. Software design is a major factor in a softwares success and usability. An effectively designed software provides the user with a sense of professionalism and satisfaction. A software with weak software design may be hard to utilise all features resulting in a failed software. Spotify is the music listening software that I use due to all of its benefits and accessibility. Overall, Spotify is effectively designed and its design is a large contributor to its global success. </p>

  <p>The requirement gathering stage of the development process requires immense amounts of communication and is a significant part of the process due to its major impact on the final product. Gathering requirements allows developers to understand what tasks need to be completed and in which order and priority. Gathering requirements prior to designing the code is effective as it provides a foundation for the next steps. The requirement gathering stage consists of acknowledging what problems need to be solved and who is using the software. Requirements must be clear and concise to allow all developers to view the tasks unitedly and prevent miscommunication. All requirements must follow a simple template and include an ID to be easily recognizable. Requirements can be obtained through interviews, questionnaires and user stories. A user story is a demand of the software written from a user's perspective. Ultimately, gathering requirements is a crucial component of a softwares development in order to successfully create a product that satisfies its intent. As a user, I want to have songs, artists and playlists recommended to me based on my preferences, so that I can explore new music and expand my music taste. As a user, I must be notified when new music is released, so I can remain up to date. As a user, I must be able to access all playlists and songs from the home page, so that I can easily find my music and switch songs. As a user, I must be able to connect to audio output devices including headphones and speakers so I can listen to music in my preferred ways. As a user, I must be able to access the application through mobile and desktop devices and connect, so that the application is accessible and also so that I have control over music from multiple devices.

  <p>Communication is vital in software design to create a successful product through collaboration. To demonstrate strong communication skills, one must avoid leading questions to prevent communication barriers and misunderstandings. Additionally, one must be honest to convey the correct information clearly and with certainty. Finally, one must be willing to listen and consider opposing perspectives to gain a greater understanding of the software's development process. Correct communication allows the team to efficiently work alongside one another and strengthen the overall product. On the contrary, weak communication can result in misunderstanding the task and producing an ineffective program. An example of weak communication and its negative impact on reaching a goal occurred when my roommate Andrew and I moved in together on residence at the start of the current semester. Prior to setting up our dorm, Andrew and I ineffectively communicated about significant plans for moving in. When purchasing items for the room such as shelves, posters, and rugs, Andrew and I were not fair and did not consider sharing our space on the ground and walls. In addition, while planning our dorm, I was distracted by external sources resulting in a lack of mindfulness and attention. My lack of attention caused me to miss that Andrew had already bought himself a new mini-fridge that we could share and that I did not need to rent my own. After mistakenly renting my own mini-fridge, we had to adapt our room layout plans to fit a second fridge, wasting more space and emphasizing our previous issue of sharing the limited space. With stronger communication skills, we could have optimized our space and saved money to create a better living environment. Ultimately, this course has taught me to be mindful and acknowledge other perspectives when communicating to produce optimal results.

  <p>A valuable principle of design is the eighth principle stating that projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted. This statement emphasizes that the individuals behind a task must be qualified and passionate about their project and can direct their own decisions effectively. With a lack of micromanagement and instead a team of trusted experts, a software can thrive and be designed to a high level. When a team is carefully constructed prior to building a software, the outcome will flourish. Following this principle is significant in software design as it encourages creativity and develops ownership as well. One example of this concept being evident throughout my life is during times when my friends and I play basketball together. When we play, we carefully choose our teams to ensure that we can all trust each other's skills and are equally motivated to work towards our ultimate goal of winning the game. Trust and motivation are key concepts to our success and result in a more enjoyable experience while playing basketball. In addition, another example of this principle occurred in the creation of Google applications. Google implements a 20% time rule where employees utilize 20% of their working time to focus on what they are passionate about in an attempt to develop the software. This approach requires trust in the employees and their intentions to result in creativity and expansion of their app. The use of this principle is evident due to encouraging employees to focus on their motivations and trust each other. This principle enhances the user experience as the software seems more personal and diverse as it is built by a team with their own unique approaches. Ultimately, the concept that teams must be constructed by motivated individuals who should be trusted is important in designing software and additionally, all tasks requiring teamwork and collaboration.
