  <p>Spotify is an accessible and easy to use software that allows the user to play and download music and podcasts. The application is available on both mobile and computer devices. The home page displays all saved music and playlists, recommended songs and albums, and the current song that is playing at all times. Additionally, the search feature has numerous sub genres and provides suggestions based off of the current search and the users unique music taste. Users are also provided the ability to create accounts and connect to others to save their music and podcasts as well. While playing music, the listener can skip the song, pause, rewind, connect to audio output hardware and read the lyrics. The simplicity and use of black and green helps the software remain recognizable. The limited and large button icons help the software feel user friendly and easy to use. Software design is a major factor in a softwares success and usability. An effectively designed software provides the user with a sense of professionalism and satisfaction. A software with weak software design may be hard to utilise all features resulting in a failed software. Spotify is the music listening software that I use due to all of its benefits and accessibility. Overall, Spotify is effectively designed and its design is a large contributor to its global success. </p>

  <p>The requirement gathering stage of the development process requires immense amounts of communication and is a significant part of the process due to its major impact on the final product. Gathering requirements allows developers to understand what tasks need to be completed and in which order and priority. Gathering requirements prior to designing the code is effective as it provides a foundation for the next steps. The requirement gathering stage consists of acknowledging what problems need to be solved and who is using the software. Requirements must be clear and concise to allow all developers to view the tasks unitedly and prevent miscommunication. All requirements must follow a simple template and include an ID to be easily recognizable. Requirements can be obtained through interviews, questionnaires and user stories. A user story is a demand of the software written from a user's perspective. Ultimately, gathering requirements is a crucial component of a softwares development in order to successfully create a product that satisfies its intent. As a user, I want to have songs, artists and playlists recommended to me based on my preferences, so that I can explore new music and expand my music taste. As a user, I must be notified when new music is released, so I can remain up to date. As a user, I must be able to access all playlists and songs from the home page, so that I can easily find my music and switch songs.
