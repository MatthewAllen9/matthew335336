  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>Spotify is an accessible and easy to use software that allows the user to play and download music and podcasts. The application is available on both mobile and computer devices. The home page displays all saved music and playlists, recommended songs and albums, and the current song that is playing at all times. Additionally, the search feature has numerous sub genres and provides suggestions based off of the current search and the users unique music taste. Users are also provided the ability to create accounts and connect to others to save their music and podcasts as well. While playing music, the listener can skip the song, pause, rewind, connect to audio output hardware and read the lyrics. The simplicity and use of black and green helps the software remain recognizable. The limited and large button icons help the software feel user friendly and easy to use. Software design is a major factor in a softwares success and usability. An effectively designed software provides the user with a sense of professionalism and satisfaction. A software with weak software design may be hard to utilise all features resulting in a failed software. Spotify is the music listening software that I use due to all of its benefits and accessibility. Overall, Spotify is effectively designed and its design is a large contributor to its global success. </p>
